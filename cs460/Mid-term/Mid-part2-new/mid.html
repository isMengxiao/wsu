. Timer Service

   With a hardware timer, e.g. timer0, the OS kernel can provide each process
with a virtual timer. A process may request an interval timer of t seconds by 
the command 't', which asks for a time value in t seconds. The 't' command 
causes the process to sleep for t seconds. When its interval time expires, the 
timer interrupt handler wakes up the process, allowing it to continue.

The timer requests of processes are maintained in a timer queue containing Time
Queue Elements (TQEs), which looks like the following:

     tq ->  tqe ->     tqe ->    tqe -> NULL 
           ------    ------    ------    
           | 5  |    |  8 |    | 17 |   (time in seconds to expire)
           | *2 |    | *1 |    | *3 |   (*pid means &proc[pid])
           ------    ------    ------

At each second, the timer interrupt handler decrements the time field of each 
TQE by 1. When a TQE's time decrements to 0, the interrupt handler deletes its
TQE from tq and wakes up the process.

For example, after 5 seconds, it deletes the tqe of PROC2 and wakes up process 
P2. 

In the above timer queue, the time field of each TQE contains the exact 
remaining remaining. This has the disadvantage in that the interrupt handler 
must decrement the time field of each and every TQE. In general, an interrupt 
handler should complete an interrupt processing as quickly as possible. This is 
especially important to the timer interrupt handler. Otherwise, it may loss 
ticks or even never finish. In contrast, when a process enters a timer request,
it also manipulates the timer queue but the process does not have the same kind
of critical time constraints. We can speed up the timer interrupt handler by 
modifying the timer queue as follows.

     tq ->  tqe ->    tqe ->    tqe -> NULL 
           ------    ------    ------    
           | 5  |    |  3 |    |  9 |   (relative time)
           | *2 |    | *1 |    | *3 |   (pointer to proc[pid])
           ------    ------    ------

In the modified timer queue, the time field of each TQE is relative to the
cummulative time of all the preceeding TQEs. At each second, the timer interrupt
handler only needs to decrement the time of the first TQE and process any TQE
whose time has expired. With this setup, insertion/deletion of a TQE must be
done carefully.

REQUIREMENT:

Implement a timer queue to support interval timer requests of processes.
Add a 't' command, which
          ask for a time value t in seconds, e.g. 20;
          enter a TQE into the timer queue;
          process goes to sleep (e.g. on its TQE)

Modify the timer interrupt handler to:
          display a wall clock;
          dispaly the current timer queue every second;
          handle TQEs and wake up any process whose time has expired;

NOTE: During demo, let P1 kfork() serveral processes, e.g. P2, P3.
                   P1: 't' : 30
                   P2: 't' : 20
                   P3: 't;:   5
